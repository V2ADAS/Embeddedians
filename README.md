# Embedded Graphics Project

Welcome to the Embedded Graphics Project repository! This repository is dedicated to our collaborative effort in creating an embedded graphics project. The project structure is designed for clarity, maintainability, and collaboration.

## Contributors

- **Omar Wael**
- **Amr Maghraby**
- **Mohamed Hawas**
- **Toka Bishara**
- **Maya Emad**

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main folders:

### 1. Doc Folder

The `Doc` folder contains important documentation related to project guidelines:

- **[Readme Naming Conventions](Doc/Readme.md):** This document outlines naming conventions for C files. It is crucial for maintaining a consistent and readable codebase. Contributors should follow these conventions when creating and modifying files.

### 2. Src Folder

The `Src` folder is the core of our embedded graphics project:

#### - LIB Folder

The `LIB` folder holds the standard library (STD LIB) files used throughout the project.

#### - MCAL (Microcontroller Abstraction Layer) Folder

The `MCAL` folder houses drivers for the microcontroller. Each contributor is responsible for developing and maintaining drivers within this folder. Adherence to the naming conventions outlined in the documentation is expected.

#### - HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) Folder

The `HAL` folder will contain higher-level abstractions that provide a standardized interface to interact with the hardware. This layer abstracts away the low-level details of the MCAL.

## Contributing

We encourage all contributors to actively participate in the project by:

- Adding new features
- Fixing bugs
- Enhancing the existing codebase

If you have any questions, need clarification, or want to discuss project-related matters, feel free to reach out to the project contributors. Let's collaborate and build something amazing together!

Happy coding!
